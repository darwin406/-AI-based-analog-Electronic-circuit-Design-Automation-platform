 This is software that automatically optimizes transistor size using reinforcement learning. <br/>
 <br/>
 Optimization of analog electronic circuits has traditionally been considered an expensive task that requires <br/>
 a large investment of time and effort by skilled engineers because it is difficult to automate with software.<br/>
 Research is continuing to reduce the cost, time, and performance of analog electronic circuit design <br/>
 by enabling automation through reinforcement learning. <br/>
 <br/>
 In this project, we show that reinforcement learning on a simple circuit can be used to find the optimal FOM <br/>
 and its corresponding state in fewer simulations than random search, grid search, or hand computation.<br/>
 By improving and modifying the methods proposed in DDPG(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971) and DNN_OPT(https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00211) papers, we succeeded in optimizing the transistor size. <br/>
 <br/>

## DDPG (Action scale = 0.1)
 It is almost identical to the commonly known DDPG algorithm. However, it does not use a target network. <br/>
 


## DNN_OPT (Action scale = 1)
